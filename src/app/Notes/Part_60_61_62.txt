Reactive Forms
    Form
        Elements
            Input
            Textarea
            buttons
            checkbox
            radio
            Select
            Image

    FormGroup
        Each element is a FormControl
        when one or more formcontrol are grouped together - we call it  formgroup

    Form
        FormControlName

Part 61 :
--------------------------------------------------------- - -
    FormBuilder
        - Its an abstraction layer which makes it easy to design and build our forms
        - FormBuilder to work when complex form structure
            Add / Remove
            Add / Remove
            Array of form controls

        - FormBuilder has 3 important 
            FormGroup
            FormArray
            FormControl

        - FormBuilder is the prefered one
        - FormBuilder -> break down your form into smaller pieces of code
                        which is reusable / simple to maintain


Part 62 :

    Way 1:  
    Direct way of setting the form value at form creation.

    Way 2: 
        Use setValue
        the another way of setting values of form
        Note: The setValue requires data/values for all the “fields/keys”, if you 
        don’t pass value you will see error.

    Way 3: 
        Use PatchValue 
        -> you don't have to pass all key / values
        -> only selected keys / fields data can be set
        The only difference is -> you do not have to pass all "keys/fields"

Part 63:
------------------------------------------------ - - -
   - Get Entire Form in one go
        - this.addLoanTypesForm.value
   - Get a specific form control
        - this.addLoanTypesForm.get('loanType').value 

    - Whenever you do valueChanges
        -> we have to do a subscribe
