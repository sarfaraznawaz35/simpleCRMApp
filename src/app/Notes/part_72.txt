Part 72:
-----------------------
1. Services ->
    - Service are reusable common shared functionality between different modules and component

    - Services are injected using the DI mechanism
    - Services are used for interactions with backend APIs or rest endpoints
    - Services are the one of the most critical crucial
        -> backend APIs

2. Ho do we generate the services
    -> ng g service <service_name>

3. Where should you keep the services?
    -> create a single folder to place all services

4. Whats inside a service file?
    -> @Injectable (it is a decorator, it gives information about this particular file )
        -> Dependency Injection mechanism
            it will use Dependency Injection mechanism and will be injected at run time that means 
            when you are running your application compiling it, it would directly provide it so that'why
            it is @Injectable
    -> ProvidedIn
        -> It's available whereever we inject it

5. Where can we inject the services?
    -> Inject in any component where we want to use it

6. Do we need to import this services in any Module file?
    - No
    - only imported in component where its used

7. Imported the service into the component
8. Create an instance in the constructor
9. Call the method using the instance of the service.
